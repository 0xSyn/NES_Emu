<p>From Disch's notes: &quot;when homebrewing:  choose either 4-screen or WRAM.  You can't have both&quot;
</p><p>Certainly a board could be constructed that had MMC3, PRG RAM at $6000-$7FFF, and extra nametable RAM at $2800-$2FFF. It's like saying &quot;choose either WRAM or VRAM, not both, if your game's text isn't written in Japanese&quot; because there's no such thing as NES-TNROM. --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> 09:31, 3 June 2012 (PDT)
