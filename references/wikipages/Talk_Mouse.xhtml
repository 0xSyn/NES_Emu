<p>Is there any actual data in the first byte, or is it just all zeroes? --<a href="User_Quietust.xhtml" title="User:Quietust">Quietust</a> 17:54, 9 December 2011 (UTC)

<dl><dd>It appears to be all zeroes in my tests. Kirby's Avalanche for Super NES is known not to check the signature byte; the mouse buttons show up as X and A Buttons. If the first byte were anything but all zeroes, then doing things with the mouse would cause button presses on B, Y, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, or Right. --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> 18:35, 9 December 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Since it is done the way it is, it mean, you could have the keyboard and mouse connected at the same time, it seems like. I suppose in some cases it might be useful, but I don't think any such software currently exists. --<a href="User_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User:Zzo38">Zzo38</a> (<a href="User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User talk:Zzo38">talk</a>) 14:09, 18 March 2013 (MDT)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sensitivity">Sensitivity</span></h2>
<p>I don't see any mention of how the sensitivity affects the output. The nintendulator source seems to treat sensitivity as a multiplier on the returned value (specifically 1.25x, 1.5x, 2.0x). Is this representative of what the original hardware does? - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 23:14, 22 April 2016 (MDT)
