<p><b>Read-only memory</b> is any of several types of computer memory designed to hold constant data and cannot be modified during the ordinary course of operation.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Solid_state_ROM">Solid state ROM</span></h2>
<p>These forms of ROM are integrated circuits with no moving parts:
</p>
<dl><dt><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_ROM" title="wikipedia:Mask ROM">Mask ROM</a></dt>
<dd> Program is encoded on the &quot;mask&quot;, or the shape of the integrated circuit, when the chip is fabricated. During the NES's commercial era, retail NES games were mass-produced as mask ROM because they were very cheap in volume.</dd>
<dt><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_read-only_memory" title="wikipedia:Programmable read-only memory">Programmable read-only memory</a> (PROM), One-time programmable (OTP)</dt>
<dd> Early PROMs were an array of fuses that could be changed from 1 to 0. Later PROMs were UVEPROMs without a window.</dd>
<dt><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPROM" title="wikipedia:EPROM">Ultraviolet erasable programmable read-only memory</a> (UVEPROM)</dt>
<dd> Variant of PROM using field-effect transistors that turn back to 1 upon exposure to strong ultraviolet light through a window over the chip. In general, one would erase one of them by putting it in a box that shines UV on them for about 20 minutes. Developer carts during the NES's commercial era used this sort of EPROM.</dd>
<dt><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM" title="wikipedia:EEPROM">Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory</a> (EEPROM)</dt>
<dd> Variant of PROM using floating-gate transistors that can be set to 0 using electricity or set to 1 using more electricity. Early solid-state disk devices were EEPROM based.</dd>
<dt><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory" title="wikipedia:Flash memory">Flash memory</a></dt>
<dd> EEPROM that can be erased a page at a time, where a page can be several thousand bytes or more. Modern developer and retail carts use flash memory.</dd></dl>
<p>An NES Game Pak has a PRG ROM connected to the <a href="CPU.xhtml" title="CPU">CPU</a> and either a second CHR ROM or a CHR RAM (or, rarely, both) connected to the <a href="PPU.xhtml" title="PPU">PPU</a>.
</p><p>Solid-state ROMs are measured by the number of words times the length of each word.
On the NES and Super NES, each word is 8 bits; on the Sega Genesis it is 16 bits.
The size in words of the vast majority of ROMs is a power of 2: 16384, 32768, etc.
<a class="external text" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=72781#p72781" rel="nofollow">Some Super NES carts support multiple PRG ROM chips</a> allowing a non-power-of-two as a sum of different ROM sizes, but on the NES, no Nintendo board supports more than one PRG ROM or more than one CHR ROM, except for some very early mapper 0 boards (<a href="NROM.xhtml#Variants" title="NROM">RTROM and STROM</a>) that took two 8 KiB PRG ROMs and one 8 KiB CHR ROM.

<dl><dt><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM" title="wikipedia:CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a></dt>
<dd> An optical disc that holds data to be copied into a RAM and used there. There are three kinds of CD: CD-ROM acts like Mask ROM, CD-R acts like PROM, and CD-RW with <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/packet_writing" title="wikipedia:packet writing">packet writing</a> acts like flash memory. Access to CD is much slower than access to solid-state ROM.</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ROM_images">ROM images</span></h2>
<p>The term <b>ROM</b> can also refer to a <b>ROM image</b>, a computer file that represents the entire contents of a ROM or a set of ROMs.
The majority of NES ROM images are distributed in the <a href="INES.xhtml" title="INES">iNES</a> or <a href="NES_2_0.xhtml" title="NES 2.0">NES 2.0</a> format.
