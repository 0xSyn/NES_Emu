<p>The &quot;Envelope Speed&quot; section has this quote:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>BIOS or game code appears to set this to $FF.</i></dd></dl>
<p>I've recently checked the FDS bios disassembly, and it seems to actually set the value to $E8, as seen at $ee72 in the BIOS:
</p>
<pre>$EE72	LDA #$e8
$EE74	STA $408A</pre>
<p>FDS games may set the envelope speed to $FF; However, I haven't checked any of them, so I wouldn't be able to tell you. --<a href="User_Freem.xhtml" title="User:Freem">Freem</a> 20:47, 12 January 2013 (MST)
