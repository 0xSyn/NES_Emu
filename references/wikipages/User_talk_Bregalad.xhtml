<p>The edit summary for <s>this edit</s> is fine. But the edit summary &quot;idem&quot; for <s>this</s>, <s>this</s>, <s>this</s>, and <s>this</s> confuses future readers of the individual articles' edit histories. Recent Changes isn't the only place where edit summaries are shown; they're also shown in individual articles' edit histories, where they aren't correlated with edits to other pages on the same day. Will other editors be able to tell what &quot;idem&quot; means <s>here</s>, <s>here</s>, <s>here</s>, and <s>here</s>? --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 07:17, 20 April 2015 (MDT)

<dl><dd>You are correct, I only had recent changes in mind. Unfortunately I don't know how to edit the edit summary of past edit to fix the problem.<s>128.179.154.122</s> 07:55, 20 April 2015 (MDT)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>A subsequent trivial edit with an edit summary to explain could do it fine, and would be easily read in the page history. - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 20:31, 20 April 2015 (MDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
