<p>On the page it says that in power-up state, the bank mode is 2, which is 8K. While I don't have any experience with testing out hardware mappers, I do have some ROMs that have this mapper and both don't have valid interrupt vectors in the first 8K. It seems to me more likely that the power-up state is bank mode 0 (32K), which both my emulators seem to use for this mapper. If I configure my emulator to use another bank mode at boot, the game won't run.--<s>Tai Ferret</s> (<s>talk</s>) 10:52, 5 April 2016 (MDT)

<p>I can also confirm that the Mapper implementation works (at least for the Contra 16 100-in-1 ROM) only when the starting bank mode is 0, not 2.
