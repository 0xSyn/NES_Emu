<p><i><b>Videomation</b></i> is a paint program for NES using the <a href="CPROM.xhtml" title="CPROM">CPROM</a> board, published by THQ in 1991.
</p><p>It can be seen as the spiritual predecessor of <i>Mario Paint</i>.
It has no save feature; the extra battery-backed RAM that would be needed was seen as an unnecessary cost in the VHS era.
It has no <a href="Mouse.xhtml" title="Mouse">mouse</a> support, but instead a button can be pressed to toggle among various cursor speeds (much as in <i>Image Fight</i>), and one of the pens has &quot;race car&quot; style control.
Animation is with one of eight predefined sprites, and music depends on the animation.
The fill tool is extremely slow.
