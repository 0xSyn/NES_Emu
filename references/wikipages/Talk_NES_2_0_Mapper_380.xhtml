<p>Why has this been allocated? There doesn't appear to be any publicly available ROM that requires this. If you are drafting a new mapper on your userspace, that's fine, but don't allocate a slot for it until you've actually made something. - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 10:55, 17 April 2015 (MDT)

<dl><dd>Have de-allocated it, currently redirecting back to <a href="Mapper.xhtml#Plane_1" title="Mapper">Mapper#Plane 1</a>. Feel free to re-allocate it when there is a published ROM that requires it. - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 14:14, 24 April 2015 (MDT)</dd></dl>
