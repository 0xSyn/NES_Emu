<p>Whatever this IC looked like, if it was ever not just an epoxy blob, it probably existed in a 24-pin package.
</p><p>For the behavior described here, the following 22 signals must be attached to it:
Vcc Gnd /ROMSEL CPU_A14 CPU_A8 CPU_A0 CPU_M2 CPU_D0 CPU_D1 CPU_D2 PRG_A15 PRG_A16 PRG_A17 PPU_A10 PPU_A11 PPU_A12 CHR_A11 CHR_A12 CHR_A13 CHR_A14 CHR_A15 CHR_A16
</p><p>Plus at least one of the following two:
CIRAM_A10 or PPU_A13
</p><p>The behavior described on <a href="INES_Mapper_137.xhtml" title="INES Mapper 137">iNES Mapper 137</a> is satisfied by the addition of one 74'153 as well as specifying one extra digital output for the contents of register 6.

<dl><dd>Unfortunately, I don't know much about the chip(s); just what I've seen other emulators implement.  But what you say does make sense.  <a href="User_Natt.xhtml" title="User:Natt">Natt</a> (<s>talk</s>) 13:39, 31 January 2014 (MST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> Evidently I'm wrong! The Pirated (Pirates') Games Forum had a thread ( s4.zetaboards.com/PGC_Forums/topic/9974526/1/ ) with a picture of Rockball's PCB. It was on the PCB <b>TC-A003-72P</b> and had two mask ROMs, a place for PRGRAM, a CIC stunner, and a 28-pin 0.6&quot; DIP labelled SA8259A. ( img31.imageshack.us/img31/8521/r93f.jpg ). Cah4e3 has a <a class="external text" href="http://cah4e3.shedevr.org.ru/%5Blst%5D-sachen-mappers.txt" rel="nofollow">writeup</a>, including a pinout, which I'll incorporate into the wiki here shortly. —<a href="User_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User:Lidnariq">Lidnariq</a> (<a href="User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User talk:Lidnariq">talk</a>) 16:00, 31 January 2014 (MST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Indirect_addressing">Indirect addressing</span></h2>
<p>It'd be nice to be consistent across the wiki about how we refer to indirectly addressed mapper registers:
</p>
<ul><li> Yamaha synthesizer IC datasheets call it address/data</li>
<li> The AY-3-8910 datasheet calls it 'latch address'/'write to psg'</li>
<li> The TI SN7649x datasheet calls it register address/data</li>
<li> <a href="MMC3.xhtml" title="MMC3">MMC3</a> calls it bank/bank data</li>
<li> <a href="Sachen_8259.xhtml" title="Sachen 8259">Sachen 8259</a> calls it select/(data/internal)</li>
<li> <a class="mw-redirect" href="Sunsoft_FME_7.xhtml" title="FME-7">FME-7</a> calls it command/parameter</li>
<li> <a href="Sunsoft_5B_audio.xhtml" title="Sunsoft 5B audio">Sunsoft 5B audio</a> calls it audio register select/write</li>
<li> <a href="VRC7_audio.xhtml" title="VRC7 audio">VRC7 audio</a> calls it register select/write</li></ul>
