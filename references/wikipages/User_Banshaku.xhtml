<p>I'm the main admin of the nesdev wiki now located on parodius servers.  
</p><p>I started to get interest about nes programming since a long time ago but never had the chance to put any time in it.  I started officially to experiment with it in june 2008 as a way to change my mind from my current programming task I had at work (flash in AS 2.0, terrible).
</p><p>Since then, I started to build my how generic map editor in C# and still working on it when I can find the time.  I needed to find some test data to see if it worked properly so I ended up making Concrete Man stage map. Since then, I have been working on my game engine which will be used in the <a href="Mega_Man_9_proof_of_concept.xhtml" title="Mega Man 9 proof of concept">Mega man 9 proof of concept</a>.
