<dl><dd> Detecting the difference between the 2C02 and 2C03 comes down to detecting 1 missing pixel out of every 178684 pixels. Thefox tried to do this in the forum - <a class="external free" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9210" rel="nofollow">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9210</a> - but it didn't work very well. Detecting the 2C04 or 2C05 is easy, but they're incompatible with existing software, so it's not clear why one would bother. —<a href="User_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User:Lidnariq">Lidnariq</a> (<a href="User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User talk:Lidnariq">talk</a>) 12:51, 8 March 2013 (MST)
<dl><dd>Then what is the best way for the software to deal with the difference of RGB and NTSC modes? --<a href="User_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User:Zzo38">Zzo38</a> (<a href="User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User talk:Zzo38">talk</a>) 13:53, 11 March 2013 (MDT)
<dl><dd>Compile time, or asking the user. You cannot plug a Famicom or NES game pak into a Vs. System or PC10 cabinet, and aftermarket modifications (2C03s in NESes/Famicoms) impose no obligation to support. —<a href="User_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User:Lidnariq">Lidnariq</a> (<a href="User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User talk:Lidnariq">talk</a>) 15:29, 11 March 2013 (MDT)
<dl><dd>A Game Pak plugs into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famicom_Titler" title="wikipedia:Famicom Titler">Famicom Titler</a> or a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C1_NES_TV" title="wikipedia:C1 NES TV">C1 NES TV</a>, both of which use the same RGB PPU as the PlayChoice. However, it appears developers settled for &quot;compile time&quot;, as the box of <i>Just Breed</i> carries a warning not to use the game with Sharp Famicom TVs. --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 17:08, 11 March 2013 (MDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I'm noticing bne :+ is being displayed as bne ;:+ and some of the comments have the ; doubled for some reason. I think there's something wrong with the source tag. - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 22:31, 5 March 2014 (MST)
