<p>This page (and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Mega_Man.xhtml" title="Rockman">Rockman</a>) is kind of embarrassing, and was created to fix the redlinks from HVC around the wiki. I'd like to get rid of both.—<a href="User_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User:Lidnariq">Lidnariq</a> (<a href="User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User talk:Lidnariq">talk</a>) 11:30, 2 April 2013 (MDT)

<dl><dd>Well, I don't really think the &quot;great games&quot; section belongs here, anyways. If made to fix redlinks, it might be made redirect if it would help. --<a href="User_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User:Zzo38">Zzo38</a> (<a href="User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User talk:Zzo38">talk</a>) 12:34, 2 April 2013 (MDT)</dd>
<dd>I rewrote it entirely. Now it's a document about the difference between the Famicom and NES. As for <a class="mw-redirect" href="Mega_Man.xhtml" title="Rockman">Rockman</a>, I just moved it to <a href="Mega_Man.xhtml" title="Mega Man">Mega Man</a>, and we might likewise be able to use that page to document architectural lessons learned from the Mega Man engine (sort of like I did with my dissection of <a href="Bad_Apple.xhtml" title="Bad Apple">Bad Apple</a>) or emulation issues related to Mega Man games. --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 13:12, 2 April 2013 (MDT)</dd></dl>
