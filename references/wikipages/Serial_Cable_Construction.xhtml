<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h1>
<p>RS-232 serial communication uses +12 and -12V signals, while the NES/Famicom console uses +5V and 0V, commonly referred to as TTL. Connecting RS-232 directly would damage the console, so the RS-232 levels must be translated to/from TTL. RS-232 is also inverted from normal, so a converter inverts the signals as well. Thus, a converter translates +12V to/from 0V, and -12V to/from +5V. There are a few ways to do this conversion, described below. There are also a few ways to connect the converted signals to the NES/Famicom consoles, described separately. A cable is a combination of a conversion method and connection method, so there are even more possibilities.
</p><p>RS-232 signals are named TxD, RxD, CTS, and GND. Inverted TTL-level signals are named TX, RX, /CTS, GND, and +5V. The NES should <i>never</i> be connected directly to any RS-232 signals, except GND.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="FTDI_TTL-232R">FTDI TTL-232R</span></h2>
<p>The FTDI TTL-232R cable plugs into a USB port on almost any computer and provides the necessary TTL signals for the NES. This cable is by far the simplest to use and has high-quality drivers for modern operating systems (Windows, OS X, Linux). It is well worth its cost. You'll also need a male header, 0.1 inch spacing, with 5 pins in a row (if more, you can cut off the extras). Cutting and stripping the wires is not recommended, because you might want to use the FTDI cable for other devices which have a header connector as well, like the popular Arduino microcontroller boards.
</p><p><i>Do not</i> connect the red or green wires to anything. Also, <i>avoid</i> the TTL-232R-3V3 cable which uses 3.3V signals and will not work with the NES.

<p>The MAX232 level converter chip internally generates the RS-232 +/-12V, ensuring compatibility with any serial port. Pay close attention to the counter-intuitive capacitor polarities. If possible, also connect pins 1, 4, and 6 of the RS-232 connector together, which helps the PC determine that something is connected.

<p>Two transistor-based inverters convert well enough to work with many current serial ports.
</p><p>For a one-way PC to NES cable, construct an inverter that converts -12V to +5V and +12V to 0V (left-hand schematic). A diode prevents a -12V input from exceeding the transistor's reverse breakdown voltage, which would damage the transistor over time (note diode's orientation).  If possible, also connect pins 1, 4, and 6 of the RS-232 connector together, which helps the PC determine that something is connected.
</p><p>For a two-way cable that allows NES to PC as well, additionally construct a second inverter on the NES output (right-hand schematic). While this only goes down to 0V instead of -12V, it works with many modern serial ports. This has worked on everything I've tried so far, including a few PL2303-based USB serial adaptors, and the built-in serial port on a Dell PC. It's only the NES to PC direction that doesn't follow the spec exactly; PC to NES will work with all serial ports.

<p>The expansion port is the only way to connect on the Famicom. If desired, an external controller can still be connected at the same time as serial, as serial uses D4. A Neo-Geo controller extension cable can be used, as it has the same connector. A PC joystick connector <i>will not work</i>, due to having insufficient depth.

<p>Connecting to the expansion port avoids disruption of the second controller entirely, but connectors are hard to find, if they exist at all. Another option is to solder directly to the circuit board, and put the serial circuit inside the NES.
