<p>First, thank you for adding those pages on compression. They are a great idea, and definitely an improvement for the wiki.
</p><p>Now, it would be great if you mentionned my program, compress_tools. <a class="external free" href="http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/882/" rel="nofollow">http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/882/</a>
</p><p>This was written especially with NES games in mind, although it is certainly not restricted to this usage. I do not want to add this myself, as I do not want to do too much self-publicity, and it would be hard to talk about this program with a totally objective point of view. If other compression tools are relevent, please add info about them too.
