<p>I'm noticing a bunch of branching pseudo-instructions starting with J instead of B. I presume this refers to an inverted branch across a JMP instruction, but given that this is tutorial material, shouldn't only real instructions be used? This code seems to be dependent on custom macros? ca65 does come with &quot;.macpack longbranch&quot;, but they don't use a capital J as far as I understand, and ASM6 doesn't have anything of the sort packaged with it, does it? - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 19:43, 16 March 2016 (MDT)

<dl><dd>Okay, I just found the definitions at <a href="Fixed_cycle_delay.xhtml" title="Fixed cycle delay">Fixed cycle delay</a> (left there by mistake?), which makes me understand that they're really just the straight branch with a page check. I think this is really bad nomenclature because of the already existing longbranch conventions which have the same names but different function. - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 20:13, 16 March 2016 (MDT)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Sorry about the confusion. I'm not sure where I adopted these macros from. But that's what they do, branch with page-wrap check. The longbranch functions are named similarly, but with a lowercase j, not a capital J. --<a href="User_Bisqwit.xhtml" title="User:Bisqwit">Bisqwit</a> (<s>talk</s>) 22:22, 17 March 2016 (MDT)
<dl><dd>Would bccnw, beqnw, etc. describe the intent better? --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 16:55, 20 March 2016 (MDT)
<dl><dd>Maybe. Should I change it? --<a href="User_Bisqwit.xhtml" title="User:Bisqwit">Bisqwit</a> (<s>talk</s>) 12:35, 21 March 2016 (MDT)
<dl><dd>I think it would be a good idea to change them, yes. I don't have much opinion about what to use (&quot;nw&quot; seems as good as many), just I don't like the current similarity to the longbranch macros. - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 12:23, 24 March 2016 (MDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
