<p><b>iNES Mapper 192</b> is used to designate a board, used by Chinese developers, similar in capability to TQROM (<a href="INES_Mapper_119.xhtml" title="INES Mapper 119">iNES Mapper 119</a>).
It uses a clone of the <a href="MMC3.xhtml" title="MMC3">MMC3</a> but uses the CHR bank number in such a way so as to allow <a href="MMC3_with_CHR_ROM_and_CHR_RAM.xhtml" title="MMC3 with CHR ROM and CHR RAM">both CHR ROM and CHR RAM to be used simultaneously</a> for displaying Chinese characters.
</p><p>BizHawk supports this mapper as of r3973; FCEUX and FCEU-MM have supported them for a long time but definitely as of 26-nov-2012, although CRC checks for m192&lt;-&gt;m074 may be lacking.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Registers">Registers</span></h2>
<p>Registers resemble <a href="MMC3.xhtml" title="MMC3">MMC3</a>, except CHR ROM banks 8, 9, 10, and 11 are replaced with CHR RAM.
Other (unknown) inaccuracies compared to an authentic MMC3 may be present.
This is effectively the same as <a href="INES_Mapper_074.xhtml" title="INES Mapper 074">INES Mapper 074</a> but with twice as much CHR RAM.
If the <a href="NES_2_0.xhtml" title="NES 2.0">NES 2.0</a> header is present, 74 and 192 should be emulated identically, as NES 2.0 specifies CHR RAM size elsewhere.

 Notes:
 --------------------------
 This mapper is a modified MMC3 (or is based on MMC3?).
 
 In addition to any CHR-ROM present, there is also an additional 4k of CHR-RAM which is selectable.
 
 CHR Pages $08-$0B are CHR-RAM, other pages are CHR-ROM.
 
 Apart from that, this mapper behaves exactly like your typical MMC3.  See mapper 004 for details.
