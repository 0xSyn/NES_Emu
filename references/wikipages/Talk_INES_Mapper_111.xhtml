<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Like_MMC1.2C_except_direct_access_to_registers.3F">Like MMC1, except direct access to registers?</span></h2>
<p>NesterJ's source code has a definition for Mapper 111 that implies that it is similar to the MMC1 except that the registers are directly accessible instead of needing to be fed 1 bit at a time. It is intended for a Chinese translation of Ninja Gaiden.
</p><p>8000-9FFF: ...C PPMM (Control register)
</p><p>A000-BFFF: ...C CCCC (CHR bank 0)
</p><p>C000-DFFF: ...C CCCC (CHR bank 1)
</p><p>E000-FFFF: ...R PPPP (PRG bank)
</p><p>The code is poorly organized, so I don't know if the reset bit (originally set by writing 0x80 to any register) is implemented at all.
