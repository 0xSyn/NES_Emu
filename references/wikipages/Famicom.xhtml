<p><b>Family Computer</b> (or <b>Famicom</b> for short) is a video game console made by Nintendo and sold in Japan starting in 1983.
The Nintendo Entertainment System, which Nintendo sold outside Japan a couple years later, is nearly identical in behavior with a few changes in the cords, controllers, system look.
While the Famicom was made to look friendly and well matched for a Japanese household with bright colors, the NES was made to look like the &quot;future&quot; to get it into the homes of Americans who had been burned by the crash of the second-generation consoles in 1983-1984.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_from_NES">Differences from NES</span></h2>
<ul><li> On the original Famicom, <a href="Standard_controller.xhtml" title="Standard controller">controller</a> 2 has no Select and Start buttons; they always return &quot;not pressed&quot;. The AV Famicom uses standard NES controllers.</li>
<li> Controller 2 on the original Famicom has a microphone. It is missing on the AV Famicom.</li>
<li> There is a <a href="Famicom_expansion_port_pinout.xhtml" title="Famicom expansion port pinout">15-pin expansion port</a>. The light gun and other specialty controllers connect to this instead.</li>
<li> Only one specialty controller, such as the <a href="Zapper.xhtml" title="Zapper">Zapper</a> or <a href="Power_Pad.xhtml" title="Power Pad">Power Pad</a>, may be connected at once. Even the AV Famicom isn't wired to accept specialty controllers made for the NES.</li>
<li> The original Famicom had only RF output, not the yellow and red AV output seen on the side of the front-loading NES.</li>
<li> Reset acts like a top-loading NES, not a front-loading NES: the Reset button resets only the CPU, not the PPU.</li>
<li> The &quot;cassette&quot; connector on the Famicom is smaller than the &quot;Game Pak&quot; connector on the NES. Famicom cassettes have 60 pins instead of 72. However, the pin pitch is slightly wider: 2.54 mm (0.1 in) on the Famicom vs. a nonstandard 2.50 mm on the NES.</li>
<li> No expansion port on the bottom, and no ten passthrough pins on the cassette connector.</li>
<li> No CIC.</li>
<li> The Famicom audio path goes through the cassette, allowing boards to mix the console's audio with that from a synthesizer chip.</li>
<li> The Famicom is always NTSC. PAL Famiclones are designed for compatibility with the NTSC Famicom; the <a href="Clock_rate.xhtml" title="Clock rate">clock rate</a> preserves the ratio of PPU to CPU cycles, and the extra scanlines are added to the post-render period instead of vertical blanking so that cycle-counting mapper IRQs and cycle-timed NMI handlers continue to work.</li></ul>
