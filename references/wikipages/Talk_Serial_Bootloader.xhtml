<p>It's interesting to see how you came to different solutions for the same issues that I found when trying to design a cart with no Flash/EPROMs.  Well, technically possibly a USB or SD-card slot containing a Flash drive.  Thanks for sharing this project with us!  I'll be sure to return the favor once I'm able to prototype my card and buy the system to test it.  I can't wait for when you're ready to start discussing the design.  :)  <a href="User_Alphamule.xhtml" title="User:Alphamule">alphamule</a> (<s>talk</s>) 07:51, 30 August 2014 (MDT)
