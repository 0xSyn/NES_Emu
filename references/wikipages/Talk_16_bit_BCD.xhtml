<p>These kind of description of arithmetic stuff is useful. There might be useful to have a category for this. I also asking about a signed version, but I suppose such thing wouldn't be too difficult (print a minus sign and then XOR by 65535 and then add one, and then do it with unsigned). --<a href="User_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User:Zzo38">Zzo38</a> (<a href="User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User talk:Zzo38">talk</a>) 17:07, 24 August 2013 (MDT)

<dl><dd>Good idea. I made <a href="Category_Arithmetic.xhtml" title="Category:Arithmetic">Category:Arithmetic</a>. You can probably populate it by going through the last week of <s>Special:Contributions/Koitsu</s>. --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 17:30, 24 August 2013 (MDT)</dd></dl>
<p>I seem to remember optimizing this routine way back, at the very least to eliminate that unnecessary sec in the loop. Make it a clc, adjust the low table, and take the clc out of the loop since the bcc ensures it's clear each time through.<s>Blargg</s> (<a href="User_talk_Blargg.xhtml" title="User talk:Blargg">talk</a>) 11:06, 25 November 2013 (MST)
