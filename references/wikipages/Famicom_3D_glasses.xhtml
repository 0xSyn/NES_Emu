<p>The <i><b>Famicom 3D System</b></i> is an accessory for the FamiCom that was only released in Japan in 1987. The 3D system consisted of a pair of liquid crystal shutter glasses that received video signals through dual 3.5mm jacks on a special adapter. It gave compatible games the illusion of 3D depth. Most games released would play in conventional 2D until a &quot;3D mode&quot; was activated by use of the select button. — <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famicom_3D_System" title="wikipedia:Famicom 3D System">from Wikipedia</a>
