<p>wow this is making me quite excited. i love megaman 9. would there be any plans to... port the game as a rom file in it's entirety?<a href="User_Durda_dan.xhtml" title="User:Durda dan">Durdadan</a>

<dl><dd>The chances are slim to none.  The goal is not to remake the game but to prove it could have been doable on the nes.  Since I'm the only programmer and have almost no time to work on it, I would take many years before it could be possibly done. Mega man 15 have more chances to comes out before :) <a href="User_Banshaku.xhtml" title="User:Banshaku">Banshaku</a></dd></dl>
