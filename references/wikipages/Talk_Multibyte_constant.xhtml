<p>Maybe just put both versions on some sort of page like <s>Multibyte constant code</s> and find a place to link to them from. Is there a &quot;programming techniques&quot; page? - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 21:30, 29 June 2015 (MDT)

<dl><dd>You are correct; perhaps it ought to be. I don't know if &quot;programming techniques&quot; page exists though; if not should it be made up? But, maybe a category might help. --<a href="User_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User:Zzo38">Zzo38</a> (<a href="User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User talk:Zzo38">talk</a>) 22:42, 29 June 2015 (MDT)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think <a href="Programming_guide.xhtml" title="Programming guide">Programming guide</a> currently has a bunch of links to snippets of code like this. It could go there. - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 10:29, 30 June 2015 (MDT)
