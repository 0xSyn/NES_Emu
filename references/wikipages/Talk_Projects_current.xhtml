<p>I don't think the new format is appropriate. I see what you want to do, to try to show what is the project and description but to me it feels more like cluttering the visual than anything.  I think the previous approach was simple and obvious enough.  We should revert to the previous design. <a href="User_Banshaku.xhtml" title="User:Banshaku">Banshaku</a> 01:28, 4 November 2009 (UTC)
