<p>Summary: reading or writing $2007 during rendering will cause the VRAM address to increment by <b>1 scanline</b>, just like it does at the beginning of HBLANK. I tracked this down within Visual2C02 a while ago, though I don't recall exactly how it works at the moment. --<a href="User_Quietust.xhtml" title="User:Quietust">Quietust</a> (<s>talk</s>) 21:24, 27 March 2013 (MDT)
