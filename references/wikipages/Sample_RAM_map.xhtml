<p>Documents about programming for systems using the 6502 CPU often refer to RAM in 256-byte &quot;pages&quot;.
The NES has a 2048 byte RAM connected to the CPU, which provides eight such pages at $0000-$07FF.
The optional PRG RAM chip on some cartridge boards is an 8192 byte SRAM that provides 32 pages at $6000-$7FFF.
</p><p>It's up to you to find uses for this memory, within certain restrictions imposed by the NES's architecture.
Indirect addressing modes on 6502 rely on the &quot;zero page&quot; or &quot;direct page&quot;, which lies at $0000-$00FF.
Some other addressing modes can read or write the zero page slightly faster.
The stack instructions (PHA, PLA, PHP, PLP, JSR, RTS, BRK, RTI) always access the &quot;stack page&quot;, which lies at $0100-$01FF.
But you can use the parts of the stack page that those instructions aren't using.
</p><p>Here's a sketch of a memory map that may work for your programs.
Feel free to adapt it to fit your needs.
