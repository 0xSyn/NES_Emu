<p>The other description on <a href="CPU_ALL.xhtml" title="CPU ALL">CPU ALL</a> is pretty good, but I wanted to present the flags in a way that conceptually makes clear that in the processor, they are just 6 separate flags with no ordering in a byte, and that it's when they're <i>copied</i> to a byte in memory that the other two bits of the byte are given values. I tried to emphasize that the memory version is a copy, which conceptually avoids one thinking of the copy as the actual flags. --<s>Blargg</s> 08:37, 5 November 2010

<dl><dd>So can you think of some way to divide the description between <a href="Status_flags.xhtml" title="Status flags">Status flags</a> and <a href="CPU_status_flag_behavior.xhtml" title="CPU status flag behavior">CPU status flag behavior</a> so that things aren't unnecessarily covered twice? --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> 16:44, 5 November 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>
