<p>In the changelog, Tepples wrote: &quot;If it is linear like that and not switchable, then the internal organization into 2 KiB, 2 KiB, and 1 KiB banks doesn't matter from the ROM's or emulator's POV any more than the GameCube 1T-SRAM's organization into 4 KiB banks does&quot;
</p><p>What do you mean when you say &quot;not switchable&quot;? Since you made the change, I assume you don't mean the part where the slices can be enabled or disabled independently. (Not bankswitchable?)—<a href="User_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User:Lidnariq">Lidnariq</a> 00:06, 10 October 2012 (MDT)

<dl><dd>Yes, I was referring to bank switching. --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> 05:51, 10 October 2012 (MDT)</dd></dl>
