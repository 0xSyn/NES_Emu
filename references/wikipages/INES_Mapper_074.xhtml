<p><b>iNES Mapper 074</b> is a <a href="MMC3.xhtml" title="MMC3">MMC3</a> clone used in Eastern games.
It's identical to <a href="INES_Mapper_192.xhtml" title="INES Mapper 192">iNES Mapper 192</a> and used for the same reason, except that only pages 8 and 9 are RAM.
If the <a href="NES_2_0.xhtml" title="NES 2.0">NES 2.0</a> header is present, 74 and 192 should be emulated identically, as NES 2.0 specifies CHR RAM size elsewhere.
</p><p>BizHawk supports this mapper as of r3973; FCEUX and FCEU-MM have supported them for a long time but definitely as of 26-nov-2012, although CRC checks for m192&lt;-&gt;m074 may be lacking.
</p><p>Some games will be mis-headered as m074 but should really be m192 and will either need to be changed to the correct mapper, or changed to the correct amount of CHR RAM and handled by unified code.

 --------------------------
 Pirate MMC3 variant
 
 
 Example Games:
 --------------------------
 Di 4 Ci - Ji Qi Ren Dai Zhan
 Ji Jia Zhan Shi
 
 
 Notes:
 --------------------------
 This mapper is a modified MMC3 (or is based on MMC3?).
 
 In addition to any CHR-ROM present, there is also an additional 2k of CHR-RAM which is selectable.  CHR pages
 $08 and $09 select CHR-RAM, other pages select CHR-ROM
 
 Apart from that, this mapper behaves exactly like your typical MMC3.  See mapper 004 for details.
