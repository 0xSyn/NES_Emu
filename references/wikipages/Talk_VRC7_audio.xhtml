<p>The OPLL datasheet (transcribed here- <a class="external free" href="http://www.smspower.org/maxim/Documents/YM2413ApplicationManual#tableii2" rel="nofollow">http://www.smspower.org/maxim/Documents/YM2413ApplicationManual#tableii2</a>) suggests that the delays should be 12cy (A-&gt;D) and 84cy (D-&gt;A) of the 3.6MHz xtal, or ~3 and 21 NOPs <a href="User_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User:Lidnariq">Lidnariq</a> 20:26, 15 May 2012 (PDT)

<dl><dd>Yeah, I looked it up afterwards when I realized this info should be in the datasheet. I plan to do some testing of this later to make sure the numbers are good enough; the earlier ballpark guesses were just from trying things until it worked-- I believe some of the registers finish updating faster than others, so my guesses were a bit off from the recommended times, apparently. - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> 20:44, 15 May 2012 (PDT)</dd></dl>
