<p>Suggest move to &quot;Category:Mappers with bankable PRG RAM&quot; (bank-switchable? Exact word choice uncertain...) but 'large' is vague and the page clearly specifies that it means bank-switchable. <a href="User_Myask.xhtml" title="User:Myask">Myask</a> (<a href="User_talk_Myask.xhtml" title="User talk:Myask">talk</a>) 16:57, 21 April 2015 (MDT)

<dl><dd>If you want to make it not vague, I'd actually suggest to define it in the category that anything over 8k is &quot;large&quot;. That's a pretty meaningful boundary in terms of NES PRG-RAM. Banking isn't necessarily the qualification (should the FDS RAM adapter be in this category?) - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 17:16, 21 April 2015 (MDT)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>My point is more that the name of the category itself is vague. The description given on the page is perfectly serviceable. This feels more like it's telling me that such-and-such mappers have Huge Guts. <a href="User_Myask.xhtml" title="User:Myask">Myask</a> (<a href="User_talk_Myask.xhtml" title="User talk:Myask">talk</a>) 18:38, 21 April 2015 (MDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
