<p>Thanks for helping convert the nesdev main page ;) Hope Memblers will like it <a href="User_Banshaku.xhtml" title="User:Banshaku">Banshaku</a> 01:03, 7 November 2009 (UTC)
</p><p>I finished to convert the page today but I didn't have time to check any link. Thanks again for the help. <a href="User_Banshaku.xhtml" title="User:Banshaku">Banshaku</a> 03:07, 7 November 2009 (UTC)
</p><p>The goal of the div with color on the nesdev page was to try to reproduce the actual color scheme of the original page, to try to keep the page identity in a way.  It was not finished and didn't saw the header were gone.  I will test it in another sandbox page <a href="User_Banshaku.xhtml" title="User:Banshaku">Banshaku</a> 08:27, 8 November 2009 (UTC)
