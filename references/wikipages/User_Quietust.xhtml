<p>He is a former member of the NESdev community, though he still occasionally makes minor contributions to this wiki.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="What_sort_of_stuff_has_he_done.3F">What sort of stuff has he done?</span></h3>
<p>He wrote the NES emulator <a href="Nintendulator.xhtml" title="Nintendulator">Nintendulator</a>, as well as some simple <a class="external text" href="http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/" rel="nofollow">NES demos</a>.
</p><p>He also traced out the RP<a href="2A03.xhtml" title="2A03">2A03</a>G die (excluding the 6502 embedded within it) and used the information to make an <a class="external text" href="http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/chipimages/visual2a03/" rel="nofollow">interactive simulator</a> (based on the <a class="external text" href="http://visual6502.org/" rel="nofollow">Visual 6502</a> project). His findings suggested that <a href="CPU_pin_out_and_signal_description.xhtml" title="CPU pin out and signal description">pin 30</a> enabled <a href="File_Apu_address_jpg.xhtml" title="File:Apu address.jpg">4 additional I/O registers at $4018-$401A</a>, a theory which he later verified using his own CopyNES.
</p><p>He began to do the same for the RP2C02G, the NTSC NES <a href="PPU.xhtml" title="PPU">PPU</a>, though he does not expect it to be complete until mid-to-late 2012 due to unavailability of delayered die shots. Detailed status can be found <a class="external text" href="http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/chipimages/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Where_can_I_contact_this_.27Quietust.27_person.3F">Where can I contact this 'Quietust' person?</span></h3>
<p>Your best bet would probably be to email him (@gmail.com). He can also be found occasionally on irc.freenode.net using the nickname &quot;_Q&quot;.
