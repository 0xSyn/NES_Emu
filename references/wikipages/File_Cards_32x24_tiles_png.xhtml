<p>A set of 128 tiles from which 32x24 pixel playing cards can be built, for the <a href="Placeholder_graphics.xhtml" title="Placeholder graphics">placeholder graphics</a> collection. Use these to make your own NES game, with blackjack and hookers. (See <a href="File_Cards_32x24_png.xhtml" title="File:Cards 32x24.png">File:Cards 32x24.png</a> for how the assembled cards look.)
</p><p>This is for the poker deck, including a black joker.
It is missing several cards from the tarot deck, such as the other 21 trumps, and the rank &quot;N&quot; that represents Jack's older brother.
Those would cause the set to exceed 128 tiles.
