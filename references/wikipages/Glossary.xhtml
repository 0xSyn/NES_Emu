<dl><dt>10NES</dt>
<dd>The program running on the <a href="CIC_lockout_chip.xhtml" title="CIC lockout chip">CIC</a>.</dd>
<dt>60-pin</dt>
<dd>Referring to Famicom cassettes. The Famicom and most famiclones for the Asian market use 60-pin cassettes, which have audio passthrough and no lockout chip.</dd>
<dt>72-pin</dt>
<dd>Referring to NES Game Paks. The NES and most famiclones for the North American and European markets use 72-pin Game Paks, which have expansion port passthrough and a different lockout chip for each market.</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A">A</span></h2>
<dl><dt>Address decoding</dt>
<dd>Translation of addresses on the console's address buses into chip enables and addresses for the various ROMs and RAMs in the cartridge. In most cartridges, this involves some form of bank switching.</dd>
<dt>ASIC</dt>
<dd>Application specific integrated circuit. Used with mappers involving complicated logic that the IC chip is made specific to this purpose.</dd>
<dt>Attribute</dt>
<dd>A part of video memory that selects which part of the palette is used for a given sprite or area of the background.</dd>
<dt>Attribute table</dt>

<dd>A grid of tiles (programmed using <a class="mw-redirect" href="PPU_nametables.xhtml" title="Nametable">nametables</a>).</dd>
<dt>Bank switching</dt>
<dd>The primary function of a mapper. Because the CPU and PPU don't have enough address space to see the entire ROM at once, the ROM is conceptually divided into &quot;pages&quot; or &quot;banks&quot;, where the most significant bits of the ROM address are treated as a page number. The CPU writes a page number to the mapper's port, and the mapper puts this number on the most significant bits of the ROM address to make the selected page visible to the rest of the system. More advanced mappers have &quot;fine-grained bank switching&quot;, which makes separate banks available in separate windows of the address space.</dd>
<dt>Battery RAM</dt>
<dd>RAM made nonvolatile by the addition of a battery backup circuit. This is used to let the player save progress in games with more than one chapter. Almost all battery RAM in NES games is PRG RAM; a couple games on very uncommon mappers have battery-backed CHR RAM.</dd>
<dt>BFT</dt>
<dd>&quot;BFT&quot; in <a class="mw-redirect" href="NESdev_IRC_channel.xhtml" title="IRC">#nesdev</a> does not stand for Big Fake/Fat/Freaking anyThing, Blunt Force Trauma, or aBout Freaking Time. It originated from what amounted to a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_game#Arts" title="wikipedia:Drinking game">drinking game</a> around the Broken Film Transition commonly used in the TV series <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters" title="wikipedia:MythBusters">MythBusters</a></i>.

<dd>ROM in the cartridge which is connected to the PPU, normally mapped at $0000-$1FFF and holding pattern tables.</dd>
<dt>Checking Integrated Circuit (CIC)</dt>
<dd>Nintendo's term for what the public knows better as the lockout chip.</dd>
<dt>CIC clone</dt>
<dd>A microcontroller generating the same pseudorandom stream as the authentic CIC. Examples include Tengen's Rabbit and Kevin Horton's CIClone.</dd>
<dt>CIC stun</dt>
<dd>Freezing the CIC by using a charge pump to pulse negative voltage on the data pins.</dd>
<dt>CIRAM (Console-Internal RAM)</dt>
<dd>A 2048-byte SRAM in the NES, normally mapped at $2000-$2FFF on the PPU bus (subject to mirroring controlled by the Game Pak). Holds nametables and attribute tables.</dd>
<dt>Collision</dt>
<dd>The coincidence or overlapping of two &quot;objects&quot; which may be made of background tiles, one or more sprites, or a combination of these.  Collision detection is done by the software since the Famicom/NES hardware has no collision detection circuitry.</dd>
<dt>Color Generator RAM (CGRAM)</dt>
<dd>A 28-entry RAM inside the PPU, holding the palette.</dd>
<dt>Control Deck</dt>
<dd>The console itself, into which the Game Pak is inserted and to which the controllers and outputs are connected.</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="D">D</span></h2>

<dt>DRAM</dt>
<dd>Dynamic random access memory, or memory that needs to be periodically refreshed.</dd>
<dt>Draw time</dt>
<dd>Time outside vertical blanking, when the PPU is busy drawing the picture.</dd>
<dt>Duty cycle</dt>
<dd>The fraction of a cycle a signal stays high. For example, most input clock signals have a duty cycle of 50%. The <a href="APU_Pulse.xhtml" title="APU Pulse">pulse channels</a> in the APU have a variable duty cycle.</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="E">E</span></h2>
<dl><dt>Expansion audio</dt>

Often used to store interrupt handlers, code that accesses large amounts of data spread across several banks, or anything else that must always be available. Several mappers fix the last bank of the PRG ROM at $C000-$FFFF or $E000-$FFFF. Mappers that use outer bank switching will have a separate fixed bank for each outer bank.</dd>
<dt>Flip</dt>
<dd>Reflection of an image. For example, a &quot;vertical flip&quot; turns an M into a W as the pixels move vertically across a horizontal axis.</dd>
<dt>Forced blanking</dt>
<dd>Turning off the rendering circuitry by writing zero to <a href="PPU_registers.xhtml" title="PPU registers">$2001</a>, giving the CPU the same access to VRAM through the PPU ports that the CPU normally has during vertical blanking.</dd>
<dt>Front-loader</dt>

<dt><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf" title="wikipedia:Code golf">Golf</a></dt>
<dd>Aggressive micro-optimization of a program for speed or size, often as a friendly competition to produce the fastest or smallest version of a particular routine. Compare the concept of &quot;frame wars&quot; in the tool-assisted speedrun community. In practice, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_optimization" title="wikipedia:Premature optimization">golf is far less necessary</a> on the NES than on the Atari 2600 except in a few cases. These include squeezing 17K of code into 16K for an <a href="NROM.xhtml" title="NROM">NROM</a>-128 release, squeezing a routine into a ROM hack of an already tightly packed game such as <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, getting a routine to finish in one frame or one vertical blank, or producing a code library used by other programs that have a similar reason to be space or time efficient.</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="I">I</span></h2>
<dl><dt>IRQ</dt>
<dd>Interrupt request, a maskable hardware interrupt.  Used most often by external hardware to do split-screen scrolling or to trigger events (like disk-loading on the Famicom Disk System or ending a game on the NES-EVENT boards).</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="L">L</span></h2>
<dl><dt>Left pattern table</dt>
<dd>The pattern table at PPU $0000-$0FFF. So-called due to display conventions in debugging emulators.</dd>
<dt>Lock-on</dt>
<dd>Referring to a cartridge with two connectors: one to connect to the console and another to connect to another cartridge to use its CIC and/or to modify its program.</dd>
<dt>Lockout chip</dt>
<dd>Nintendo's scheme used in the front-loading NES to block the use of infringing copies of its games and to reassure retailers that the NES wouldn't have the flood of low-quality games seen on second-generation consoles. Nintendo was successfully sued in antitrust court over this and other practices. It consists of two 4-bit CIC microcontrollers, one in the Control Deck and one in each Game Pak, passing a stream of pseudorandom numbers back and forth.</dd>
<dt>Lockout defeat</dt>
<dd>Various ways of getting a program to run without an authentic CIC. These include CIC clone and CIC stun.</dd></dl>

<dt><a href="Mirroring.xhtml" title="Mirroring">Mirroring</a></dt>
<dd>Presence of one memory area at more than one place in the memory map.  In the PPU memory, mirroring is used in the nametables to repeat the screen horizontally or vertically, thus the distinguishing terms &quot;horizontal mirroring&quot; and &quot;vertical mirroring&quot; are used.</dd>
<dt><a href="Multicart.xhtml" title="Multicart">Multicart</a></dt>
<dd>A cartridge containing several otherwise unrelated programs.</dd></dl>

<dt>PRG RAM</dt>
<dd>RAM in the cartridge on the CPU bus, in contrast to the internal RAM at $0000-$07FF which is usually called main RAM, system RAM, or just RAM. With few exceptions, PRG RAM is located at $6000-$7FFF and decoded with the equivalent of <a href="PRG_RAM_circuit.xhtml" title="PRG RAM circuit">a circuit like this</a> inside the mapper.</dd>

<dt>Proportional font</dt>
<dd>A font whose glyphs (character pictures) have different widths. These can fit more text onto the screen than the more common monospace (fixed-width) fonts but are rarely used on NES because of the processing overhead involved with drawing each line of text.</dd></dl>

<dd>To repeatedly read a particular address in a loop until its value changes. A program can spin on an input port or on a RAM address that is modified by an interrupt handler.</dd>
<dt>Sprite</dt>
<dd>An entry of 4 bytes in OAM, controlling a small block of 8x8 pixels that can be moved around on the screen. It has X and Y coordinates, a tile index into one of the pattern tables, vertical and horizontal flip switches, and priority.</dd>
