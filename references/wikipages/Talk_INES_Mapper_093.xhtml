<p>If, for some reason, you were to remove the 8KiB CHR RAM IC on the Sunsoft-3R PCB and replace it specifically with a 62256 (the largest compatible 28-pin RAM), the functionality of that PCB would then become:
</p>
<pre> $8000-FFFF:  [.PPP .C.C]
    P = PRG Reg  (16k @ $8000)
    C = 8KiB CHR RAM bank
</pre>
<p>No-one has ever done this.—<a href="User_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User:Lidnariq">Lidnariq</a> (<a href="User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User talk:Lidnariq">talk</a>) 12:12, 12 May 2013 (MDT)

<dl><dd> Are you capable of running a test ROM for bankable CHR RAM? It could be used as part of the test suite for this mapper's NES 2.0 representation. --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 15:24, 12 May 2013 (MDT)
<dl><dd> No, I don't have the parts on hand. I think I'd rather define all discrete logic mappers as &quot;can be used to bank CHR-RAM in place of CHR-ROM if the NES2.0 header specifies no CHR ROM and more than 8KiB CHR RAM&quot; rather than formalizing the above idiosyncrasy of noncontiguous bits; e.g. m70 with CHR-RAM is strictly superior for homebrew because it supports 4 bits for each of CHR and PRG instead of 2 and 3, respectively. —<a href="User_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User:Lidnariq">Lidnariq</a> (<a href="User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User talk:Lidnariq">talk</a>) 16:33, 12 May 2013 (MDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
