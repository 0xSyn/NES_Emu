<p>I don't see why the PPU read mode of the interval timer should be labeled &quot;wtf&quot;. Wouldn't an IRQ mode based on PPU reads just clock 170 times per scanline? It'd be sort of like CPU mode, except not dependent on the <a href="Clock_rate.xhtml" title="Clock rate">CPU to PPU clock ratio</a>. And it'd be unaffected by &quot;borrowing&quot; 8x16 sprites from the other pattern table, which trips up PA12-rise PITs such as MMC3's. With the /256 prescaler, it would appear fairly straightforward to work with: as the last thing in vblank, load 170/256 (very close to two-thirds) times the number of scanlines to wait. Apart from &quot;CPU writes&quot; and &quot;funky mode&quot;, I see nothing particularly strange about 90's PIT. Or is there something harsh that I'm missing? --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 23:04, 10 May 2014 (MDT)
