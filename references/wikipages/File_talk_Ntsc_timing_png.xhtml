<p>the first green ppu cycle 0 on the visible scanline 0 seems to be misleading.
according to blargg's odd/even frame test, this skipped cycle should be arranged at the last ppu cycle of the pre-render scanline, and the idle cycle presented in the image should be a read (if odd + rendering enabled).

<ul><li>One of the comments (at the lower-right) states that the skipped cycle is actually at y=261,x=340 (and circuit analysis confirms that this is when it happens); I'm not sure why it's shown the way it is on the diagram. --<a href="User_Quietust.xhtml" title="User:Quietust">Quietust</a> (<s>talk</s>) 05:23, 11 December 2013 (MST)
<ul><li>Might it have to do with the long-standing off-by-one error in cycle counts? --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 06:28, 11 December 2013 (MST)</li>
<li>I think I drew it like that to avoid giving the impression that the final NT fetch on the pre-render line is skipped during odd frames. What really happens is that the final cycle of the fetch moves to (0,0), replacing the idle tick. Can't think of a non-convoluted way to express that in the diagram. --<a href="User_Ulfalizer.xhtml" title="User:Ulfalizer">Ulfalizer</a> (<s>talk</s>)</li></ul></li></ul>
