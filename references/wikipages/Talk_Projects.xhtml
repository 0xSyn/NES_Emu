<p>I don't think the new format is appropriate. I see what you want to do, to try to show what is the project and description but to me it feels more like cluttering the visual than anything.  I think the previous approach was simple and obvious enough.  We should revert to the previous design. <a href="User_Banshaku.xhtml" title="User:Banshaku">Banshaku</a> 01:28, 4 November 2009 (UTC)
</p><p>Can we bump the &quot;homebrew&quot; section so it's above the &quot;demo&quot; section? I would think that current homebrew would be more popular than the older tech demos. --<a href="User_Drag.xhtml" title="User:Drag">Drag</a> 22:34, 7 April 2011 (UTC)
