<p>Hello everyone, my name is Brad and I'm a student majoring in computer science who is extremely interested in the NES hardware and software.  I hope to learn enough to make some contributions to the community. For now I mainly creep around in the background, absorb as much knowledge as possible, and polish my skill set.
</p><p>I'm an active member at <a class="external text" href="http://www.nintendoage.com" rel="nofollow">Nintendoage</a>, and I recommend anyone who hasn't been there to check it out!
