<ul><li> Two NAND gates making an SR latch using PPU A11 and A10, producing CHR A12 or A13</li>
<li> One NAND gate decoding PPU A12 &amp; A13 to make PRG A15</li>
<li> One NAND gate decoding two of the three of (/ROMSEL, A12, M2) going to 6264 RAM -CE
<ul><li> The last of those three signals goes to 6264 +CE</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>A few complicating factors:
</p>
<ul><li> the PPU always fetches 34 tiles per scanline, so even with a scroll of (256,240) it will fetch from the nametable at $2800 before it fetches the sprites.</li>
<li> At this precise moment, Visual2C02 is simulating the unused sprite fetches as coming from tile 0, not tile $FF as documented elsewhere.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>This is precisely the hardware I intended to be required. I was aware of the first &quot;complicating factor&quot; but not the second; this probably just means the section about CHR bankswitching should be written more clearly; it should still work as long as the correct assumptions are being made. --<a href="User_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User:Zzo38">Zzo38</a> (<a href="User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User talk:Zzo38">talk</a>) 20:11, 4 January 2014 (MST)</dd></dl>
