<p>Does the goal of this page differ in any way from the existing page: <a href="Errata.xhtml" title="Errata">Errata</a>? Maybe it would be better to merge or rename than start another page with duplicated and/or mysteriously slightly different information? - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 11:22, 29 October 2015 (MDT)

<dl><dd>I didn't know <a href="Errata.xhtml" title="Errata">Errata</a> existed when I made it.

<p>Can you explain how this can happen, or otherwise provide a source for this statement? - <a href="User_Rainwarrior.xhtml" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> (<s>talk</s>) 11:24, 29 October 2015 (MDT)
