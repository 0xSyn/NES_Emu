<p>Thanks for fixing the accidental <code>.org.org</code> in the link to my ATT user page. I must have had CNET syndrome that day.
</p><p>FYI: What you saw beginning with <code>[//allthetropes</code> was called a &quot;protocol-relative link&quot;. If you follow a protocol-relative link from an <code>http:</code> page, it'll connect to the other server with <code>http:</code>, and if you do so from an <code>https:</code> page, it'll connect to the other server with <code>http:</code>. See <a class="extiw" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.18#Protocol-relative_URLs" title="mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki 1.18">mediawikiwiki:MediaWiki 1.18#Protocol-relative URLs</a>. --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 14:51, 16 August 2015 (MDT)
</p>
<dl><dd>I do know what protocol-relative URIs are. However, it seems to me that if the protocol is FILE then it might not work (unless MediaWiki takes care of that on the server-side; also that they shouldn't be used between two entirely different sites)...but that is your page and you can fix how you want it to do. --<a href="User_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User:Zzo38">Zzo38</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 09:37, 18 August 2015 (MDT)
<dl><dd>You have a good point about <code>file:</code> breakage. The next &quot;Offline HTML version&quot; will transform protocol-relative URLs into <code>http:</code> URLs. As for the rule &quot;they shouldn't be used between two entirely different sites&quot;, is there an RFC or other spec documenting this? --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 12:45, 18 August 2015 (MDT)
<dl><dd>I don't know; ignore me if I am wrong. --<a href="User_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User:Zzo38">Zzo38</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 10:40, 19 August 2015 (MDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
