<p>Should this be &quot;if the last <i>5</i> bytes are not all zero&quot;? &quot;A general rule of thumb: if the last 4 bytes are not all zero, and the header is not marked for NES 2.0 format, an emulator should either mask off the upper 4 bits of the mapper number or simply refuse to load the ROM.&quot; -<a href="User_Ulfalizer.xhtml" title="User:Ulfalizer">Ulfalizer</a> (<s>talk</s>) 03:45, 14 July 2013 (MDT)

<dl><dd>When I wrote 4 as the rule of thumb, I didn't know how many not-widely-adopted extensions to original iNES were floating around, and I guessed that one or more might have used byte 11 for something, but all of the ROMs I saw with DiskDude and similar tags had at least something in the last four bytes of the header. --<a href="User_Tepples.xhtml" title="User:Tepples">Tepples</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tepples.xhtml" title="User talk:Tepples">talk</a>) 07:48, 14 July 2013 (MDT)
<dl><dd> Makes sense. Just wanted to check whether it was a typo. -<a href="User_Ulfalizer.xhtml" title="User:Ulfalizer">Ulfalizer</a> (<s>talk</s>) 09:06, 14 July 2013 (MDT)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Nestopia checks the last 6, and clears/ignores the last 9. (It also actually does pay attention to bytes 8 and 9)—<a href="User_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User:Lidnariq">Lidnariq</a> (<a href="User_talk_Lidnariq.xhtml" title="User talk:Lidnariq">talk</a>) 11:21, 14 July 2013 (MDT)</dd>
<dd>If the header contains &quot;DiskDude!&quot; or one of those other things (I forget now, but I knew at one time and figured this out), then bit2 of flags 7 will be set; otherwise bit2 and bit3 should both be cleared. This may be another way. --<a href="User_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User:Zzo38">Zzo38</a> (<a href="User_talk_Zzo38.xhtml" title="User talk:Zzo38">talk</a>) 19:51, 20 August 2013 (MDT)</dd></dl>
