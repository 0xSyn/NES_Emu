<p><b>Rockman</b> (<b>Mega Man</b> outside Japan) is a franchise  coined by Capcom back in 1987. it is a simple platformer with jumping and shooting action.
the game itself was one of the, if not, THE first game with a choice as you what path you chose. of course, it wasn't as in-depth as Fable, but it gave the players something more than other games of the time. the game was an immediate hit, both in America and in Japan. it was so big that sequel after sequel was released, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,x,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8.... and the list goes on, Mega Man has appeared in countless amounts of games, as both cameos, playable characters, or npcs. He is a fan favorite. if you like Astro Boy, you'll love Mega Man just as much.

<p>Virtually no program released as commercial off-the-shelf software is perfect.
<i>Mega Man 3</i> was not only the first <i>Mega Man</i> game to use the <a href="MMC3.xhtml" title="MMC3">MMC3</a> but also fairly rushed in production, and like some other early MMC3 games, its scroll splits are somewhat glitchy.
An emulator aiming for <a href="Game_bugs.xhtml" title="Game bugs">bug-for-bug</a> compatibility must reproduce the glitch above Shadow Man in the level select and a glitch at the top of the weapon menu.
