<p>I had a different setup for this mapper, much like what Nintendulator does. Looks like the mapper info described here (and Kevtris) doesn't work, <i>at least in my emulator</i>. Anything written at <b>$8000-$9FFF</b> selects the PRG ROM block. Anything written at <b>$A000-$FFFF</b> selects the PRG ROM page. I didn't edit the wiki page, since I need confirmation from someone. --<a href="User_Zepper.xhtml" title="User:Zepper">Zepper</a> 19:41, 3 March 2012 (PST)
